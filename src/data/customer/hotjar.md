detailsTitle: 'How Hotjar Consolidated Product Analytics Using NextSaaS Dashboards'

overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'A single dashboard for all product signals.'
  description: >
    Hotjar needed to unify user recordings, feedback, heatmap data, and usage analytics.
    NextSaaS Dashboards provided one interface for monitoring all product signals in real time.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Insights spread across separate tools.'
  description: >
    Product teams spent too much time switching between tools, creating inconsistent interpretations of user behavior.
    Heatmap data lived in one platform, session recordings in another, and user feedback was scattered across multiple
    systems. This fragmentation made it difficult to connect the dots between different signals, leading to incomplete
    understanding of user needs. Analysts had to manually correlate data from different sources, which was
    time-consuming and prone to errors.

      We finally had a single place to view all product signals. This unified view transformed our ability to understand
      user behavior holistically. Instead of piecing together insights from multiple tools, we can now see the complete
      picture instantly.

    NextSaaS Dashboards synced Hotjar's recordings, events, user feedback, and segmentation into unified, filterable
    dashboards. The platform integrated seamlessly with Hotjar's existing tools, pulling data from session recordings,
    heatmaps, surveys, and analytics platforms. Custom dashboards were created for different product areas, allowing
    teams to focus on metrics relevant to their features. Advanced filtering and segmentation capabilities enabled deep
    dives into specific user cohorts, while automated alerts notified teams of significant behavior changes.

    Teams aligned faster, reduced time spent on manual reporting, and delivered product improvements with greater
    confidence. The unified dashboards enabled cross-functional collaboration, with product, design, and engineering
    teams working from the same data. Issues were identified and addressed more quickly, as teams could see the full
    context of user behavior without switching between tools. The time saved on data collection and reporting was
    redirected toward analysis and strategic product decisions.

      This directly improved how quickly our teams spotted and fixed UX issues. Having all product signals in one place
      means we can make decisions faster and with more confidence. The impact on our product development velocity has
      been significant.
