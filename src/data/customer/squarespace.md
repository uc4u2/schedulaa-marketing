  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'Clarity on the entire customer journey.'
  description: >
    Squarespace wanted to understand where users were dropping during onboarding and template selection.
    NextSaaS Funnels provided detailed, granular insights into user actions across their signup flow.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Unknown friction in key user flows.'
  description: >
    Despite strong traffic, many users abandoned the process before publishing a website. Legacy tools lacked the depth
    to show where users got stuck. The growth team knew that users were dropping off during onboarding, but could not
    pinpoint exactly which steps were causing frustration. Without granular funnel analytics, it was impossible to
    identify whether the issue was template selection, domain setup, payment processing, or content creation. This lack
    of visibility prevented the team from making targeted improvements that would have the biggest impact on conversion
    rates.

    NextSaaS Funnels tracked every interaction, from template selection to domain setup, showing exactly where users
    dropped and why. The platform integrated seamlessly with Squarespace's existing analytics infrastructure, capturing
    detailed event data at every step of the user journey. Custom funnels were configured for different user segments,
    allowing the team to understand how behavior varied between first-time users, returning visitors, and different
    traffic sources. Advanced filtering capabilities enabled deep dives into specific cohorts, revealing patterns that
    were not visible in aggregate metrics.
