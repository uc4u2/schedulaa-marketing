overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'Stronger visibility across distributed teams.'
  description: >
    Asana manages thousands of ongoing projects across engineering, product, design, and customer operations.
    They needed clearer cross-team visibility to identify bottlenecks and ensure on-time delivery.
    NextSaaS Cross-Project Dashboards provided unified reporting across all departments to improve planning and execution.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The Problem'
  titleTwo: 'Project insights were scattered across teams.'
  description: >
    Each team tracked progress differently, leading to inconsistent reporting and slow escalation of delays.
    Leadership lacked a unified view to measure timelines, workloads, and dependencies. Engineering teams used Jira boards,
    product teams relied on spreadsheets, and design teams tracked milestones in separate tools. This fragmentation made it
    nearly impossible to get a complete picture of project health or identify cross-team bottlenecks before they impacted delivery schedules.

  titleTwo: 'Faster delivery, fewer surprises.'
  description: >
    Asana reduced project delays by identifying blockers earlier and improving resource allocation.
    Teams now collaborate around consistent, real-time data, leading to smoother releases and stronger alignment.
    The unified dashboards enabled proactive decision-making, allowing leadership to reallocate resources before bottlenecks became critical.
    Cross-team visibility improved communication and reduced the time spent on status meetings, while automated reporting freed up program
    managers to focus on strategic planning rather than data collection.
