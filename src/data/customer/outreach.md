overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'Stronger insights for global sales teams.'
  description: >
    Outreach needed deeper analytics to help revenue teams understand rep performance and streamline outbound
    workflows. NextSaaS provided automation, predictive scoring, and unified dashboards to help Outreach optimize
    pipeline health and increase productivity across distributed sales teams.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Fragmented insights slowed revenue decisions.'
  description: >
    Sales teams relied on multiple tools for activity tracking, forecasting, and cadence performance. Data was
    inconsistent, and leaders lacked a complete view of rep effectiveness and deal health. CRM data lived separately
    from email engagement metrics, call logs were in another system, and forecasting required manual spreadsheet work.
    This fragmentation made it difficult to identify top performers, understand what activities drove wins, or predict
    pipeline health accurately. Revenue operations spent significant time each week reconciling data from different
    sources.

      Before NextSaaS, we were stitching together data from too many places. It slowed our decision-making every week.
      Now we have a unified view that gives us confidence in our forecasts and helps us identify coaching opportunities
      much faster.

    NextSaaS connected Outreach activity logs, CRM data, call outcomes, and sequence performance into unified
    dashboards. Predictive signals identified at-risk deals, and automated workflows helped reps prioritize the
    highest-impact actions. The platform integrated seamlessly with Salesforce, Outreach.io, Gong, and other sales
    tools, creating a single source of truth for all revenue data. Machine learning models analyzed historical patterns
    to predict deal outcomes and identify which activities correlated with successful closes. Automated alerts notified
    managers when deals needed attention or when reps were falling behind on key activities.
