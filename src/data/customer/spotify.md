overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'Sharper personalization for millions of listeners.'
  description: >
    Spotify wanted deeper behavioral insights to improve music recommendations and increase session engagement.
    NextSaaS Intelligence unified listening data across devices, enabling more accurate recommendations and faster
    detection of preference changes.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Fragmented listening signals across platforms.'
  description: >
    User behavior varied widely between mobile, desktop, TV, and smart speakers. Existing internal tools struggled to
    merge these signals into a unified listener profile, resulting in inconsistent recommendations. Each platform
    generated data in different formats and at different intervals, making it difficult to create a comprehensive view
    of user preferences. The personalization team could not accurately predict what users wanted to hear because they
    were working with incomplete data. This fragmentation led to suboptimal recommendation quality and reduced user
    engagement across the platform.

  titleTwo: 'A unified intelligence layer powering recommendations.'
  description: >
    NextSaaS integrated real-time listening sessions, skip patterns, playlist saves, and interaction depth into a
    consolidated intelligence layer used across Spotify's personalization systems. The platform connected data streams
    from all devices and platforms, normalizing the information into a unified format that machine learning models
    could process effectively. Real-time processing ensured that recommendation engines had access to the most current
    user behavior data, enabling faster adaptation to changing preferences. The consolidated layer provided a single
    source of truth for all personalization features, from Discover Weekly to Daily Mix playlists.

  titleOne: 'The result'
  titleTwo: 'Higher retention and more meaningful listening sessions.'
  description: >
    Engagement increased as recommendations became more relevant. Spotify saw longer sessions, improved playlist
    satisfaction, and higher overall listener retention across global markets. The unified intelligence layer enabled
    more accurate predictions of user preferences, resulting in playlists and recommendations that users actually
    wanted to hear. This improvement in relevance led to increased daily active users and longer average session times.
    The personalization team could now iterate on recommendation algorithms faster, testing new approaches with
    confidence that they had access to complete user behavior data.
