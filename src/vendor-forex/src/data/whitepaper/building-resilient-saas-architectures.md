# Building resilient SaaS architectures

Reliability is essential for SaaS success.  
As platforms scale, systems must withstand failures, traffic spikes, and operational uncertainty. Resilient architectures distribute workloads, automate recovery, and ensure that no single point of failure disrupts the customer experience.

With strong observability, automated rollback systems, and cloud-native patterns, SaaS teams can deliver reliable performance to users worldwide—even in unpredictable conditions.
