# The rise of API-first platforms

API-first platforms are transforming how SaaS products are built and extended.  
By prioritizing APIs as core product components rather than secondary features, companies can design systems that integrate seamlessly, scale globally, and support diverse automation workflows.

This approach empowers teams to innovate faster, collaborate with partners, and build modular experiences that expand their product capabilities far beyond the core application.
