# Subscription analytics that matter

Subscription analytics help SaaS companies understand the real drivers behind growth.  
Metrics like churn, activation, feature adoption, and lifetime value reveal patterns that guide both product and revenue decisions.

By automating data collection and applying intelligence to key segments, SaaS teams gain deeper insight into user behavior and can make faster, more informed decisions that support sustainable expansion.
