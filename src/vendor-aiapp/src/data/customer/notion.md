overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'A better foundation for AI product launches.'
  description: >
    Soshi, a Notion-integrated AI startup, needed a scalable backend to generate, schedule, and analyze social content.
    NextSaaS provided fast dashboards, automation triggers, and multi-channel integrations that helped the team move
    from hackathon prototype to funded product.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Early prototypes could not scale.'
  description: >
    The team struggled with data sync issues, slow dashboards, and limited monitoring. They needed a reliable
    infrastructure that could support thousands of automated tasks. The initial hackathon prototype worked well for
    demos but could not handle the volume required for a production product. Database queries were slow, API
    integrations frequently failed, and there was no visibility into system performance or errors. Scaling the platform
    would have required a complete infrastructure rebuild, which would have delayed their launch significantly.

      We moved from a fragile MVP to a production-ready platform in weeks thanks to NextSaaS. The infrastructure support
      allowed us to focus on building features instead of managing servers. This acceleration was crucial for securing
      our next round of funding.

  description: >
    NextSaaS delivered prebuilt dashboards, API integrations, and automation flows. This allowed Soshi to focus on
    product logic instead of maintaining infrastructure. The platform provided robust database management, real-time
    monitoring, and automated scaling capabilities that handled traffic spikes without manual intervention.
    Pre-configured integrations with social media platforms, scheduling systems, and Notion's API meant the team could
    launch features faster. Custom automation workflows enabled complex multi-step processes without writing extensive
    backend code.

      Our speed of execution doubled after adopting NextSaaS. We could ship new features in days instead of weeks, and
      the reliability improvements gave us confidence to scale aggressively. The prebuilt components saved us months of
      development time.

  titleTwo: 'Faster MVP, smoother scaling.'
  description: >
    The platform now supports thousands of scheduled tasks per day and provides real-time insights to customers
    directly inside Notion. Soshi successfully transitioned from prototype to funded startup, with infrastructure that
    scales automatically as user demand grows. The reliability improvements reduced support tickets and increased
    customer satisfaction. Real-time dashboards give the team visibility into system health and user engagement,
    enabling proactive optimization and faster feature development cycles.

      NextSaaS gave us the tools we needed to operate like a mature SaaS company. The infrastructure reliability and
      monitoring capabilities allowed the team to focus on growth rather than firefighting. This foundation was
      essential for scaling from startup to established product.
