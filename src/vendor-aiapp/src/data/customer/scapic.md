detailsTitle: 'How ScaPic Launched a Scalable AI 3D API Using NextSaaS'

overview:
  titleOne: 'Overview'
  titleTwo: 'A foundation for real-time 3D processing.'
  description: >
    ScaPic needed a scalable infrastructure to process thousands of 3D content requests per day. NextSaaS provided the
    compute, queueing, and monitoring layers required to run AI workloads reliably.

problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'AI workloads required heavy infrastructure.'
  description: >
    Rendering and processing 3D assets required GPU-intensive workflows, and ScaPic needed a more reliable backend to
    scale efficiently. The company's initial infrastructure struggled to handle spikes in demand, leading to slow
    processing times and occasional service failures. Managing GPU clusters, job queues, and storage systems required
    significant engineering resources that could have been spent on product development. As user demand grew, the
    infrastructure costs were becoming prohibitive, and the team needed a solution that could scale automatically
    without constant manual intervention.

      NextSaaS helped us reduce infrastructure strain and scale without rewriting our backend. We went from constantly
      managing servers to focusing on building features. The reliability improvements have been game-changing for our
      product.

solutionBlock:
  titleOne: 'The solution'
  titleTwo: 'A custom pipeline optimized for 3D workloads.'
  description: >
    NextSaaS delivered a custom solution including GPU scaling, automated job queues, monitoring dashboards, and asset
    delivery optimization. The platform was configured specifically for ScaPic's 3D rendering requirements, with
    intelligent GPU allocation that scaled up during peak demand and down during quiet periods. Automated job queues
    managed the processing pipeline, ensuring requests were handled in priority order and failed jobs were automatically
    retried. Real-time monitoring dashboards provided visibility into system performance, queue depths, and processing
    times, enabling proactive optimization.

    description: >
      The stability and performance improvements were immediate. We could handle ten times the traffic without any
      degradation in service quality. The automated scaling means we never have to worry about capacity planning, which
      has freed up our engineering team significantly.

resultBlock:
  titleOne: 'The result'
  titleTwo: 'Lower latency and higher reliability.'
  description: >
    ScaPic reduced processing time and can now handle 10x more 3D requests with consistent SLA performance. The
    optimized infrastructure eliminated bottlenecks that previously caused delays, resulting in faster response times
    for end users. Automated scaling ensures that the platform can handle traffic spikes without manual intervention,
    while monitoring dashboards provide early warning of potential issues. The reliability improvements have reduced
    support tickets and increased customer satisfaction, enabling ScaPic to focus on product innovation rather than
    infrastructure maintenance.
