problemBlock:
  titleOne: 'The problem'
  titleTwo: 'Limited visibility into team health.'
  description: >
    Existing reporting tools lacked depth and required manual exports that slowed decision-making. HR teams struggled to
    get a comprehensive view of employee sentiment, performance trends, and engagement patterns across different
    departments. Reports had to be manually compiled from multiple sources, which was time-consuming and often resulted
    in outdated insights by the time they reached leadership. This delay prevented proactive interventions to address
    team health issues before they escalated.

    NextSaaS Reports connected directly with Lattice's survey data, goals, and performance logs to generate automated
    reports for HR leaders. The platform integrated seamlessly with Lattice's existing HR systems, pulling data from
    employee surveys, performance reviews, goal tracking, and feedback tools. Custom dashboards were configured for
    different roles, allowing HR managers to see team-level insights while executives accessed organization-wide
    trends. Automated reports were scheduled and delivered to stakeholders, eliminating the need for manual data
    compilation.
